AlexNet was first utilized in the public setting when it won the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge(ILSSVRC 2012 contest). It was at this contest that AlexNet showed that deep convolutional neural network can be used for solving image classification.

AlexNet won the ILSVRC 2012 contest by a margin.

The research paper that detailed the internal components of the CNN architecture also introduced some novel techniques and methods such as efficient computing resource utilization; data augmentation, GPU training, and multiple strategies to prevent overfitting within neural networks.

AlexNet CNN is probably one of the simplest methods to approach understanding deep learning concepts and techniques.

AlexNet is not a complicated architecture when it is compared with some state of the art CNN architectures that have emerged in the more recent years.

AlexNet is simple enough for beginners and intermediate deep learning practitioners to pick up some good practices on model implementation techniques.
